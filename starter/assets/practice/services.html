                    <h5>Carne asada</h5>
                    <p>Arrachera usually refers to skirt steak, but keep in mind that you’ll get different opinions on
                        this depending on which region you’re in. Sometimes flank steak will be included in the
                        Arrachera realm as both skirt and flank are quick-cooking cuts that work great for tacos.

                        And yes, once the skirt steak is marinated and grilled it’s typically referred to as Carne
                        Asada, which roughly translates as “grilled beef”.

                        But don’t let the nomenclature bog you down! The taste is far more important than the phrasing
                        so let’s take a look at how you can use Arrachera to make some drool-worthy Carne Asada Tacos.
